This project implements a translator that has RQL as source language and SQL as target language. The RQL was created by Lucas Venezian Povoa during his graduate course, and have three main goals:

1. Avoid the same mistakes made by SQL, which grossly infringe the fundamentals of Relational Model;

2. Get closer its syntax to mathematics sentences, and;

3. Increase the abstraction level for both the data structure and queries specifications.
